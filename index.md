# A Brief Introduction

Hey there! My name is Matt Renaud and I'm a software engineer at
Google Inc. working on Search Infrastructure.  I really enjoy
learning, regardless of what subject, but my main area of interest is
Computer Science.

I was first introduced to Computer Science (well, just Linux actually)
around 6 years ago by my uncle Roland and was instantly intrigued when
I saw him banging away at the terminal and stuff was happening! It
turns out that I was somewhat technology sheltered up until that
point.


# Interests

## Tech/CS Related

When it comes to technology, the list of interests that I have is
quite long, and unfortunately, there isn't enough time in the day to
explore all of them so, I'll just put a small list here:

- <span class="heading">Artificial Intelligence</span>

  I'm really excited where this is going to take us in the future.

- <span class="heading">Programming Languages</span>

  I have always been interested in the way that programming languages
  are designed, and how that design effects how you approach solving a
  problem in that language.  I used to really enjoy writing everything
  in C++ but working in a huge C++ codebase has really exposed some of
  the sharper edges and limitations of the language. I find that
  working in functional languages is much more natural to me with my
  favorite language being Haskell.

- <span class="heading">Distributed Computing</span>

  For the last year or so, I've become more and more interested in
  parallel processing and distributed computing. I started out last
  year by writing multi-threaded data structure and algorithms in
  C++ using the new threading library in C++11. I didn't have more
  than one computer so I was somewhat limited in what I could do
  with regards to distributing work across a network.

  During the course of my internship at IBM, I had the opportunity to
  write software that would be running across hundreds of nodes in
  parallel, opering on files stored on a distributed filesystem. My
  time working on the project really gave me a lot of insight and
  experience into the advantages, difficulties, and drawbacks of the
  design of distributed systems.

- <span class="heading">Graphics and Computer Vision</span>

  This semester I decided to take a class on computer graphics using
  OpenGL and I've been having a lot of fun learning about it and I'm
  finding it incredibly interesting. Hopefully at some point in the
  future I'll have a chance to use what I've learned.

## Non-technology Related

I absolutely love being outside whenever I can, which as you can
imagine, clashes epically with my career choice as a computer
scientist (although not in all cases).

- <span class="heading">Exercise</span>

  I pick things up and put them down. Not really, but that is part of
  what I do. I do like to go to the gym, I also enjoy interval
  training, boot camps, and kickboxing. Regurlarly exercising really
  keeps me sane, especially throughout the school year when I have a
  lot of work to do. Since I have moved I have also started rock
  climbing, beach volleyball, ultimate frisbee and mountain biking.

- <span class="heading">Reading</span>

  I never used to, but recently I have gotten in the (good) habbit of
  reading more books. I have noticed, when reading books with
  not-so-common/advanced english in them, that my reading skills are
  not quite as good as I would like them to be, so hopefully over the
  coming years that will improve.

  I finished reading through GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden
  Braid for the first time this (2013) summer, and *wow*, was that an
  absolutely incredible book. I took a little bit of time to reflect
  on what I had learned and discovered through my mental journey, then
  went back to the first chapter and started again. I don't know if I
  will even encounter a book that has changed the way that I think as
  much as GEB.

  I have also started reading some of Asimov's work including his
  robot novels and the foundation series and I've really enjoyed
  them. I recently read Ender's Game and am currently working my way
  through Dune.
